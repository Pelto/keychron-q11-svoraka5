# Keychron Q11 ISO Nordic — Svorak Firmware

Custom QMK keymap for the Keychron Q11 (ISO encoder) with Swedish Dvorak (Svorak) layout and a special character layer for programming symbols. Both Mac and Windows use native Swedish keyboard combos.

**Hardware:** STM32L432 — 256 KB flash, 64 KB RAM. The STM32 DFU bootloader lives in system ROM (not flash). QMK reserves 4 KB for EEPROM wear-leveling, leaving **252 KB** for firmware. Current build: ~60 KB (~24%).

## Flashing

### Prerequisites

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install qmk/qmk/qmk arm-none-eabi-gcc@8 arm-none-eabi-binutils
```

> The build uses `arm-none-eabi-gcc@8` automatically. Newer GCC versions (15.x) have broken newlib headers.

**macOS keyboard setup:**

System Settings → Keyboard → Input Sources → select **Swedish** (or **Swedish – Pro**) as the active input source.

> The firmware sends native Swedish keycodes.

**Windows keyboard setup:**

Control Panel → Region → Language → add **Swedish** as the active input language.

### Build and flash

The Q11 is a split keyboard — each half has its own MCU. Flash both halves with the same firmware:

```bash
make              # build firmware
make flash        # build and flash (repeat for each half)
```

**Flash the left half (primary/USB side):**

1. Unplug USB from the left half
2. Hold **Escape** while plugging USB back in — this enters DFU mode
3. Run `make flash`

**Flash the right half:**

1. Unplug USB from the left half, plug it into the right half
2. Press the **reset button** on the bottom of the right half (small pinhole — use a paperclip) to enter DFU mode
3. Run `make flash`
4. Unplug, reconnect normally (USB to left half, TRRS cable between halves)

### Other commands

| Command          | Description                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `make compiledb` | Generate `compile_commands.json` for editor LSP |
| `make lint`      | Run QMK lint on the keymap                      |
| `make clean`     | Remove `.build/` directory and generated files  |

## Layer overview

The keyboard auto-detects the host OS (Mac or Windows) on USB connection and selects the matching base layer. The hardware slider still works as a manual override — flipping it switches layers immediately. On Linux or if detection is uncertain, the slider position is used.

Detection happens ~1 second after connection via USB descriptor fingerprinting.

| Layer | Name | Activation | RGB |
|-------|------|-----------|-----|
| 0 | MAC_SVORAK | Default (Mac switch) | Blue |
| 1 | MAC_QWERTY | Toggle MC_1 | Cyan |
| 2 | MAC_SPECIAL | Hold Right Cmd | Purple |
| 3 | WIN_SVORAK | Default (Win switch) | Blue |
| 4 | WIN_QWERTY | Toggle MC_1 | Cyan |
| 5 | WIN_SPECIAL | Hold Right Alt | Purple |
| 6 | NUMPAD | Hold NUMPAD key (double-tap to lock; tap or double-tap to unlock) | Yellow (numpad keys only, rest off) |
| 7 | MAC_FN | Hold FN (Mac mode) | Off + red F keys, yellow nav/arrows, red edit/shortcuts, green undo/redo/word-nav |
| 8 | WIN_FN | Hold FN (Win mode) | Off + red media keys, yellow nav/arrows, red edit/shortcuts, green undo/redo/word-nav |
| 9 | MAC_MOD_L | Hold Left Space (Mac) | Off + colored home row mods |
| 10 | MAC_MOD_R | Hold Right Space (Mac) | Off + colored home row mods |
| 11 | WIN_MOD_L | Hold Left Space (Win) | Off + colored home row mods |
| 12 | WIN_MOD_R | Hold Right Space (Win) | Off + colored home row mods |

The physical arrow keys in the bottom-right corner always show the OS mode:
**purple** = Mac, **red** = Windows. This indicator is visible on every layer.

**Keypress fade effect**: When any key is pressed, its LED flashes white and
smoothly fades back to the layer's base color over ~400 ms. Persistent status
indicators (Caps Lock, OS arrows, SOCD) are not affected by the fade.

## Layout

See `docs/layout.json` for the full machine-readable layout definition.

### Svorak base layer (Swedish ISO)

```
 §  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  +  `
 ⇥  Å  Ä  Ö  P  Y  F  G  C  R  L  ,  ¨
 ↵  A  O  E  U  I  D  H  T  N  S  -  '
 ⇧  ▲  .  Q  J  K  X  B  M  W  V  Z  ⇧
```

### Key behaviors

| Key | Behavior |
|-----|----------|
| Physical Caps Lock | Enter (remapped in Svorak base layers) |
| Shift (tap or hold) | Shift modifier |
| Shift × 2 | Caps Word on (or turn off all caps modes if any active) |
| Shift × 3 | Caps Lock on (or turn off all caps modes if any active) |
| RGB | Both Shift keys red when Caps Lock or Caps Word is active (Svorak/Mac QWERTY); Caps Lock key red in Win QWERTY |

### SPECIAL layer (hold Right Cmd / Right Alt)

Programming symbols via native Swedish keyboard combos (same layout on Mac and Win):

```
       {  }  [  ]  $  "  ?  &  <  >     ~
       ;  /  (  )  |     ^  #  "  ~
          :  =  @  !  \  %
```

### NUMPAD layer (hold NUMPAD key or `<>` key)

```
               /  *  -
               7  8  9  /
               4  5  6  -        Enter
               1  2  3  +
         0  .
```

**Activation:**
- **Hold** NUMPAD key (bottom-left corner or `<>` key) — momentary while held
- **Double-tap** NUMPAD key — lock layer on; keep typing numbers with both hands free
- **Tap or double-tap** NUMPAD key while locked — unlock

OS-slider flip or auto-detected OS change also clears the lock.

While the key is held, the right knob also switches from volume to zoom — see [Encoders](#encoders).

### FN layer (hold FN)

Mac and Win have separate layers with identical layout but OS-specific shortcuts.

On **Mac**, the base layer uses media/system keys in the top row (brightness, Mission Control, etc.). Holding FN overrides these with actual F keys:

```
F1  F2  F3  F4  F5  F6  F7  F8  F9  F10  F11  F12
```

On **Win**, the base layer already has F1–F12. Holding FN overrides these with the same media/system keys as the Mac base layer:

```
BriDn BriUp MCtl LPad RGB- RGB+ Prev Play Next Mute Vol- Vol+
```

Left hand — navigation cluster and shortcuts:

```
 Ins Home PgUp Refresh
 Del End  PgDn SelAll
Undo Redo Copy Paste Cut
```

Right hand — arrows, edit, and word navigation:

```
Bspc  ↑  Del
 ←    ↓   →
 W←  W→
```

| Key | Mac | Windows |
|-----|-----|---------|
| Q | Insert | Insert |
| W | Home | Home |
| E | Page Up | Page Up |
| R | Cmd+R (Refresh) | Ctrl+R |
| A | Delete | Delete |
| S | End | End |
| D | Page Down | Page Down |
| F | Cmd+A (Select All) | Ctrl+A |
| Z | Cmd+Z (Undo) | Ctrl+Z |
| X | Cmd+Shift+Z (Redo) | Ctrl+Y |
| C | Cmd+C (Copy) | Ctrl+C |
| V | Cmd+V (Paste) | Ctrl+V |
| B | Cmd+X (Cut) | Ctrl+X |
| N | Word Left (Opt+←) | Word Left (Ctrl+←) |
| M | Word Right (Opt+→) | Word Right (Ctrl+→) |
| U | Backspace | Backspace |
| I | ↑ | ↑ |
| O | Delete | Delete |
| J | ← | ← |
| K | ↓ | ↓ |
| L | → | → |

### Thumb modifier layers (hold Left or Right Space)

Home row modifier layers for one-handed shortcuts. Hold a space key to activate modifiers on that side, then press a key with the other hand.

**Cmd (Mac) and Ctrl (Win) are on the same physical finger (index)**, and **Opt (Mac) and Alt (Win) are on the same finger (ring)** — matching standard keyboard conventions and preserving muscle memory across platforms.

| Physical key | Svorak | Mac | Windows | RGB |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A / Ö | A / S | Shift | Shift | Blue |
| S / L | O / N | Opt | Alt | Magenta |
| D / K | E / T | Ctrl | Win | Green |
| F / J | U / H | Cmd | Ctrl | Yellow |

- **Left Space** activates left side (A S D F) — press the shortcut key with your right hand
- **Right Space** activates right side (J K L Ö) — press the shortcut key with your left hand

Tap either space as normal to type a space character.

### QWERTY layer (toggle MC_1)

Standard QWERTY overlay for gaming. Toggle again to return to Svorak.

On **Windows**, the QWERTY layer is gaming-optimized:
- Space keys are plain `KC_SPC` (no thumb modifier layers / home row mods)
- Shift keys are plain (no tap dance) for instant response
- Physical Caps Lock key works as Caps Lock (lights red when active)

On **Mac**, the thumb modifiers remain active in QWERTY and tap dance shift is preserved.

#### Snap Tap (SOCD filtering)

Both QWERTY layers include Snap Tap (Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions filtering) on the WASD keys. When two opposing directional keys are held at the same time (W+S or A+D), the last pressed key wins — releasing it reactivates the previously held key.

- **Auto-enables** when entering a QWERTY layer; auto-disables when leaving
- **Toggle**: press the left encoder knob while in QWERTY mode
- **Visual indicator**: WASD keys glow red when Snap Tap is active (over the cyan base color)

## Macro keys

| Key | Mac | Windows |
|-----|-----|---------|
| MC_1 | Toggle QWERTY | Toggle QWERTY |
| MC_2 | Screenshot (Cmd+Shift+4) | Print Screen |
| MC_3 × 1 | Lock screen (Ctrl+Cmd+Q) | Lock screen (Win+L) |
| MC_3 × 2 | Sleep (Opt+Cmd+Eject) | Sleep (USB HID System Sleep) |
| MC_3 × 3 | Shut down (Ctrl+Opt+Cmd+Eject) | Shut down (USB HID System Power) |
| MC_4 | Calculator | Calculator |
| NUMPAD key (bottom-left) | Hold = momentary NUMPAD + right knob zooms; double-tap = lock; tap or double-tap = unlock | Same |
| `<>` key (Svorak only) | Hold = momentary NUMPAD + right knob zooms; double-tap = lock; tap or double-tap = unlock | Same |

## Encoders

| Knob | Rotate | Press |
|------|--------|-------|
| Left | Back / Forward (Cmd+[ / Cmd+] on Mac, Alt+Left / Alt+Right on Win) | Mute (Svorak layers) / Toggle Snap Tap (QWERTY layers) |
| Right | Volume down / up | Mute |
| Right, while a NUMPAD key is held | Zoom out / in (Cmd+- / Cmd++ on Mac, Ctrl+- / Ctrl++ on Win) | Mute |

The zoom override is tied to the NUMPAD key being **physically held**, not to the NUMPAD layer being active — so a locked numpad leaves the knob on volume.
